;;; Commentary:

;; Dual light/dark theme using HSLuv colors.
;;
;; Usage (standalone):
;;   (setq frame-background-mode 'dark)   ; or 'light
;;   (load-theme 'rustcity t)
;;
;; Or with straight/use-package:
;;   (use-package rustcity-theme
;;     :straight (:host github :repo "yoshzucker/rustcity-theme")
;;     :config
;;     (setq frame-background-mode 'dark)
;;     (load-theme 'rustcity t))
;;
;; Programmatic palette access:
;;   (rustcity-palette)        ; internal semantic keys (mono0-7 + 8 hues)
;;   (rustcity-export-palette 'json 'neon)  ; ANSI/terminal names for external tools
;;
;; Display compensation:
;;   (setq rustcity-hsl-correction '(0.0 0.0 -1.5))  ; e.g. darken L a bit
;;   (rustcity-apply-hsl-correction)                 ; then reloads theme if active
;; See the defcustom docstring for details and caveats (linear approx.).
;;
;; Magit and Marginalia faces are included and follow the theme's mono ramp
;; + limited (but higher-pop) accents (with heavy use of :inherit) so that
;; highlights/headers harmonize with the neon aesthetic.
;;
;; Weight is used where gensho-theme uses it and nowhere else -- the two are
;; one design read at two temperatures, and a face that is bold in one and not
;; the other is a difference nobody asked for.  The accents carry the pop; the
;; weight carries what the weight carried there.

  "HSLuv deltas (h s l) added to every base color before hex conversion.

Intended to compensate for display characteristic differences (e.g.
perceived darkness of the neon variant mono0 background on some
setups vs. others).  The correction is applied uniformly and
linearly in HSLuv space to all 16 palette entries (mono0-7 and the
8 hues) for both neon and downpour variants.

Because the relationship between HSLuv values and actual display
response may not be perfectly linear, a single set of deltas is a
first-order approximation.  Small L adjustments are often most
effective for background lightness; large corrections can affect
ramp spacing or accent distinguishability.  Always verify visually
after changing, and prefer the smallest effective values.

The canonical design values remain in `rustcity-neon-hsl' and
`rustcity-downpour-hsl'; this option only affects derived hex palettes.

  ;; Mono ramp (perceptual lightness steps)
  ;;
  ;; Surveys of many themes reveal a clear, consistent pattern for gray ramps
  ;; used to establish visual hierarchy and a layered background texture.
  ;; Importantly, the assignment of meaning to the (typically ~8) steps of
  ;; such a ramp is itself part of the general, survey-derived knowledge:
  ;;
  ;; - A perceptual ramp (typically 6-9 steps, often computed via HSLuv or
  ;;   similar for uniform lightness) provides the foundation. The steps create
  ;;   a subtle stacked layering that remains visible even when syntax colors
  ;;   and UI elements are present.
  ;; - Related chrome elements are assigned *adjacent* steps on the ramp. This
  ;;   preserves the coherence of the layering (e.g. an active bar is one step
  ;;   "above" its inactive counterpart).
  ;; - A clear, recurring pattern is the assignment of semantic roles to an
  ;;   8-step (or similar) perceptual gray ramp. This assignment of "what each
  ;;   of the 8 levels means" is itself a general fact derived from surveys,
  ;;   not specific to any one theme:
  ;;     step ~0 (lowest): main background; also used as foreground for
  ;;                       high-attention pop elements that sit on colored
  ;;                       backgrounds.
  ;;     step ~1 (next):   subtle backgrounds for selection, current item,
  ;;                       highlights, matching regions, etc. (the standard
  ;;                       de-facto aux step on main content).
  ;;                       Dedicated dim levels (dim0/dim1, between mono0 and
  ;;                       this step) are provided for the supported modes'
  ;;                       non-selected/unreal faces, so dim can be weaker than
  ;;                       the main aux while preserving the 8-step semantics
  ;;                       for content.
  ;;     step ~2-3:        alt / medium subtle (active chrome bg, some
  ;;                       highlights).
  ;;     step ~4 (mid-low): faint / secondary (shadow, doc-face, low-
  ;;                       priority or weekend indicators).
  ;;     step ~5 (mid):    comments and other secondary / low-weight text
  ;;                       and UI elements.
  ;;     step ~6 (high-mid): prominent secondary (cursor bg, minibuffer
  ;;                         prompt, current completion item text, inactive
  ;;                         chrome fg, etc.).
  ;;     step ~7 (highest): primary / main foreground (default text,
  ;;                        active chrome text, etc.).
  ;;   (The exact numbering and lightness deltas are implementation
  ;;   details; the *role assignment to the 8 levels* is the survey-derived
  ;;   universal pattern.)
  ;; - The overall derived principle: the gray ramp layers supply the primary
  ;;   visual rhythm; color is used as accent on top of this foundation.

  ;; Layered chrome / panel texture (universal application of the above)
  ;;
  ;; To create visual depth and a layered "slab" feel even with Emacs' sparse
  ;; chrome primitives (no borders/shadows/gradients), we deliberately map UI
  ;; structural elements to adjacent ramp steps. The main content plane is at
  ;; mono0. Explicit auxiliary panels (such as the treemacs sidebar) use the
  ;; next step (mono1) via their dedicated faces for a subtle layered effect.
  ;;
  ;; For the divider between such a panel and the main content, we set it to
  ;; the main content color (mono0). This produces a clean transition without
  ;; a visible seam line that would fight the plane expression — the
  ;; distinction comes from the tone difference (where present) and the
  ;; content itself.
  ;;
  ;; We keep normal editing buffers on the main mono0 plane. The main de-facto
  ;; signal for non-active windows is `mode-line-inactive` (set to mono1 here,
  ;; providing a gentle auxiliary-layer treatment at the chrome level).
  ;; For users who want a global subtle shift for non-selected windows
  ;; or unreal buffers, we provide explicit face support for the two de-facto
  ;; modes that can use exact palette colors without inventing new ones:
  ;; solaire-mode (for "unreal" buffers) and auto-dim-other-buffers-mode (for
  ;; non-selected windows). Their dim faces are set to dim0 (a dedicated level
  ;; between mono0 and the standard aux mono1), so enabling the mode gives a
  ;; weaker aux tone while preserving the full de-facto role assignment for
  ;; the main 8 levels (subtle at mono1 etc.) on content. dim1 is also
  ;; available for customization.
  ;;
  ;; Selected tab and current content deliberately share mono0 so the working
  ;; surface feels continuous, while chrome elements (bars, header) use higher
  ;; steps for layered separation. This is ramp layering as the primary
  ;; decoration.
  ;;
  ;; See the "Gutter, dividers..." section below and README for the current
  ;; practical choices and usage notes (including how to enable the two modes).

  ;; Chrome direction -- walled / sunken / ha-ha
  ;; (garden architecture metaphor)
  ;;
  ;; Three patterns coexist for chrome elements (mode-line, tab-bar,
  ;; tab-line) that sit alongside the body.  The metaphor comes from
  ;; garden architecture: the "garden floor" is body bg (the active
  ;; editing surface) and the surroundings are chrome bg.
  ;;
  ;;   Walled: active chrome FAR from body in the fg direction (tall
  ;;     wall); inactive chrome closer to body.  The active focus
  ;;     area is surrounded by tall walls that make it stand out.
  ;;
  ;;   Sunken: active chrome at body level; inactive chrome moves
  ;;     slightly TOWARD fg from body.  The active focused window
  ;;     reads as the sunken floor; inactive surroundings rise as
  ;;     walls on the fg-facing side.
  ;;
  ;;   Ha-ha (sunken fence): active chrome at or near body level;
  ;;     inactive chrome moves AWAY FROM fg from body (into a ditch
  ;;     on the anti-fg side).  The focus area sits on garden level
  ;;     while the surrounding chrome lies in a recessed ditch.
  ;;
  ;; "Toward fg" and "anti-fg" are direction-agnostic on the brightness
  ;; ramp.  Neon has fg brighter than bg, so toward fg = brighter;
  ;; downpour has fg darker than bg, so toward fg = darker.  The
  ;; semantic (active position vs inactive position relative to body
  ;; and fg) is what matters, and it is the same in both variants even
  ;; though the absolute brightness moves the other way.
  ;;
  ;; Whether a theme can express all three patterns depends on its
  ;; palette geometry: if body bg sits at an extreme of the ramp
  ;; (e.g. pure white in Modus operandi, pure black in Modus vivendi),
  ;; the anti-fg direction has no palette room, so ha-ha is not
  ;; available -- only walled or sunken.  Rustcity keeps mono0 off the
  ;; extremes in both variants, so all three are open to it.
  ;;
  ;; Survey (source inspection, body-distance + fg-direction analysis):
  ;;
  ;;   Theme               | mode-line | tab-bar
  ;;   --------------------+-----------+--------
  ;;   Modus operandi/viv. | walled    | sunken
  ;;   Catppuccin mocha    | ha-ha     | walled
  ;;   Catppuccin latte    | sunken    | walled
  ;;   Doom one dark       | ha-ha     | ha-ha
  ;;   Doom one light      | sunken    | sunken
  ;;
  ;; All three patterns are in active use.  The same design intent
  ;; can classify differently between a theme's light and dark
  ;; variants (Doom one and Catppuccin's mode-line) because the bg/fg
  ;; direction flips while the chrome's palette direction stays
  ;; fixed.  Themes with body bg at a brightness extreme (Modus) can
  ;; only express walled or sunken (no ha-ha possible).
  ;;
  ;; The pattern interacts with the theme's "dim direction" -- where
  ;; body bg shifts when a non-active window is dimmed (by solaire /
  ;; auto-dim-other-buffers, or any equivalent mode), and whether
  ;; that direction is toward fg or anti-fg:
  ;;
  ;;   - dim toward fg: sunken keeps all "active" elements (body,
  ;;     mode-line, selected tab) at the same body-bg stratum, with
  ;;     dim'd bodies and inactive chrome rising slightly toward fg as
  ;;     a coherent unit.  Walled or ha-ha would split "active" across
  ;;     strata.
  ;;
  ;;   - dim anti-fg: active body sits on the fg side of dim'd body.
  ;;     Walled or ha-ha (active chrome aligned with active body)
  ;;     would keep "active" coherent; sunken would split it.
  ;;
  ;; This is orthogonal to whether any dimming mode is actually
  ;; enabled -- the principle applies to the static palette geometry.
  ;;
  ;; This theme commits to fully sunken: `mode-line', `tab-bar-tab'
  ;; and `tab-line-tab-current' bg = mono0 (= active body).  The
  ;; active window's chrome is visually flush with the editing
  ;; surface; the inactive window gets a visible mono1 bar.  Among
  ;; surveyed themes, the closest match is Doom one light (also
  ;; fully sunken).
  ;;
  ;; Rustcity commits to sunken because its dim direction is "toward
  ;; fg" in both variants: neon mono0 -> dim0 is brighter and neon has
  ;; fg above bg, downpour mono0 -> dim0 is darker and downpour has fg
  ;; below bg.  Sunken keeps all "active" elements bottoming out at
  ;; one stratum.  Aesthetically, chrome at body level leaves the lit
  ;; accents -- signage hues on a flush dark street -- as the only
  ;; things standing above the plane.

  ;; Accent colors (hues)
  ;;
  ;; A. Observed convergence on semantic mappings
  ;;    Across the surveyed themes there is strong agreement on hue choices for
  ;;    common semantic roles (chosen for harmony, distinguishability, and
  ;;    modern "feel"):
  ;;    - Strings/literals: green (positive, harmonious; dominant modern
  ;;      choice).
  ;;    - Keywords and control flow: purple or mauve.
  ;;    - Builtins: red or orange-red (pairs with error).
  ;;    - Functions and calls: often magenta or a blue/magenta family member.
  ;;    - Types: cyan or blue (provides structure with low pop).
  ;;    - Constants: frequently a blue or near-background hue (avoids over-use
  ;;      of warm complements).
  ;;    - Warnings/alerts: yellow (kept distinct from error red).
  ;;    - Variables/identifiers: a hue, and warm in the plurality.  Counted
  ;;      over the themes shipped with Emacs plus solarized (16 definitions):
  ;;      8 warm (orange, saddle brown, yellow-green, khaki -- tango,
  ;;      dichromacy, tsdh, wheatgrass, wombat, misterioso), 4 green, 3
  ;;      blue/cyan (adwaita, solarized, modus), 1 magenta.  None grey.
  ;;      This role was the one missing from the list above, and a role with
  ;;      no entry fell through to the mono ramp: `font-lock-variable-name-
  ;;      face' sat at step 6 on the reading that identifiers are the most
  ;;      frequent text and should not shout.  That reading is a real
  ;;      minority school, but it belongs to themes that leave *every*
  ;;      identifier-ish face uncoloured; here it made one face of eight an
  ;;      outlier -- and `outline-2' inherits this face by Emacs' own default
  ;;      (outline.el), so every level-two heading in Org came out at step 6,
  ;;      dimmer than the body text under it.
  ;;    - Errors: red (near-universal); success/DONE states: green.
  ;;
  ;; B. Strategies for choosing specific hues against a tinted background
  ;;    When the background itself carries a hue (even a very low-saturation
  ;;    one), two broad strategies are observable:
  ;;    - Analogous / cool-bias: select accent hues close to the background's
  ;;      own hue. This favors calm, harmony, and lets low-saturation gray
  ;;      layers stay prominent (seen in solarized cool variants, nord, many
  ;;      "slate" or muted dark themes).
  ;;    - Complementary / higher-pop: make greater use of opposing or warmer
  ;;      hues for stronger vibrancy and immediate visual distinction.
  ;;
  ;; C. Principles shared by both strategies
  ;;    - Strictly limit the number of distinct hues present in any single
  ;;      buffer or major UI component.
  ;;    - Rely heavily on the mono gray ramp plus `:inherit` for the majority
  ;;      of faces (outlines, directory faces, titles, etc.) so that hue noise
  ;;      does not overwhelm the gray foundation.
  ;;    - Reserve the most saturated, attention-grabbing hues for short-lived,
  ;;      interactive or transient overlays only (isearch, tooltips, avy
  ;;      leads, orderless match highlights, etc.). Persistent syntax and
  ;;      structural elements stay within the gray ramp or the limited
  ;;      semantic hues.
  ;;
  ;; D. Other recurring tendencies
  ;;    - Links often use a cool hue (blue) to differentiate navigation from
  ;;      the green used for strings.
  ;;    - Org/Magit/Agenda and similar rich modes inherit the font-lock and
  ;;      mono decisions heavily; hues are introduced only for key status
  ;;      indicators (TODO, DONE). Secondary or historical information (past
  ;;      scheduled, weekend dates, etc.) stays in the gray ramp.
  ;;    - Tables, dates, and calendar elements commonly inherit from the type
  ;;      face (cyan/blue) or fall back to mono.

  ;; === General knowledge (applicable to any theme; derived from color
  ;; theory surveys including 色彩検定/PCCS, Itten/Judd, and de-facto UI
  ;; theme analysis) ===
  ;; - Hue circle and hue difference (PCCS 24-hue circle, ~15° per step;
  ;;   色彩検定 3級 level): hue diff 0 = identical hue (vary tone only);
  ;;   diff 1 = adjacent; 2-3 = similar (類似色相配色, harmonious, stable,
  ;;   analogous basic); 4-7 = medium; 8-10 = contrast (対照色相配色,
  ;;   warm/cool opposition, clear pop); 11-12 = complementary (補色, 180°,
  ;;   strong but use carefully).
  ;; - Geometric schemes (Itten/Judd "order principle"): diad 180°,
  ;;   triadic 120°, tetradic square 90° or rectangle. These are
  ;;   number-first (geometric positions for harmony) and can feel
  ;;   artificial/sensibility-light; treat as reference only, not primary
  ;;   for image-driven themes.
  ;; - Other harmony principles (Judd 4 principles, 色彩検定): similarity
  ;;   (common attributes harmonize), clarity/contrast (明瞭性), order
  ;;   (geometric as above), familiarity (なじみ, habitual/natural combos).
  ;;   Dominant-color scheme (one main hue family + tone variations);
  ;;   tone-on-tone etc.
  ;; - UI/theme practice (from nord, solarized, modus etc.): when bg is
  ;;   tinted (low-sat hue), analogous/cool-bias (cluster near bg hue)
  ;;   favors calm + mono-ramp prominence. Complementary/higher-pop for
  ;;   vibrancy. Strictly limit distinct hues (4-8 total). Base (bg/fg/
  ;;   most chrome) = mono ramp; accents limited to semantic roles.
  ;;   De-facto semantics (strong convergence): string/literal=green,
  ;;   keyword=purple/mauve, function=magenta or blue-magenta, type=cyan
  ;;   or blue (low pop structure), constant=near-bg blue, builtin=red,
  ;;   warning=yellow, error=red; success=green; link=blue. Transient/
  ;;   highlight can use more pop. Secondary/derived faces (many org,
  ;;   calendar, etc.) fall to mono + :inherit to avoid hue noise.
  ;;   Distribution tactics: even spacing (balance), clustered (warms for
  ;;   energy/alert/seasonal, cools for structure), sector emphasis.
  ;;   Reference choice: bg hue as anchor for analogous (common for
  ;;   tinted-bg calm themes); or key semantic / natural reference.
  ;;   Overall process (structural, any theme): 1. de-facto semantic survey,
  ;;   2. choose harmony type per desired image (calm vs pop vs seasonal),
  ;;   3. limit total hues, 4. use tone/s for variation instead of more
  ;;   hues, 5. visual tune. Hue-diff theory often for 2-4 colors; for 8+
  ;;   use composites (dominant analogous group + contrast accents).

  ;; Rustcity follows the complementary/higher-pop strategy (see B above) for
  ;; its accent hues to evoke the vibrant, energetic neon city aesthetic.
  ;; Greater use of opposing or warmer hues (spread across the circle with
  ;; high saturation in neon variant) for stronger vibrancy, immediate pop,
  ;; and visual distinction against the cool industrial/rain-washed bg,
  ;; while still strictly limiting total distinct hues, relying heavily on
  ;; the (high-sat in neon) mono gray ramp + :inherit for structure and
  ;; hierarchy, and reserving the most saturated accents for transient
  ;; overlays.  This matches the "neon街" image of glowing opposing lights
  ;; (warm signage vs cool night/rain) with perceptual mono foundation for
  ;; the empty streets and rusted details.  Concrete h/s/l assignments and
  ;; the extensive mono usage apply the general patterns (A-D) + this
  ;; higher-pop choice.

  ;; Face spec discipline (Emacs `face-spec-recalc' behavior)
  ;;
  ;; When `custom-theme-set-faces' overrides a face, the override does NOT
  ;; merge with the face's defface. `face-spec-recalc' first resets every
  ;; attribute to `unspecified', then applies the theme spec on top. The
  ;; defface spec is consulted only when no theme entry matches.
  ;;
  ;; The single exception is `:extend': if the theme spec leaves it
  ;; unspecified, `face-spec-recalc' copies the value from defface. So
  ;; `:extend' is the only attribute the theme can omit and still get the
  ;; defface value.
  ;;
  ;; (`set-face-attribute' is a different, lower-level primitive with true
  ;; merge semantics -- only the listed attributes change. The theme path
  ;; goes through `face-spec-recalc' and does NOT have those semantics.)
  ;;
  ;; Consequence for rustcity: for any attribute other than `:extend' that
  ;; the defface specifies and we want to preserve, we must restate it
  ;; explicitly. Omitting it means dropping it. So:
  ;;   - `:extend'        -> omit (Emacs preserves the defface value).
  ;;   - everything else  -> state explicitly if we want it; omit only when
  ;;                         we actively want it cleared.

  ;; Decoration attribute policy (survey-derived; same structure as the
  ;; mono ramp / accent design notes above: facts -> pattern -> rustcity
  ;; choice).
  ;;
  ;; Big-picture philosophy.  Modern minimalist themes (Nord, Modus,
  ;; Catppuccin) carry visual structure through a perceptual mono ramp
  ;; (~8 steps) and adjacent bg planes; borders are removed or flattened.
  ;; Information that the plane painting cannot carry (interactivity,
  ;; diagnostics, hierarchy, state) is delegated to color accents and --
  ;; only where the plane is insufficient -- to text-decoration
  ;; attributes.  Heavier themes (Zenburn, doom-themes) keep older
  ;; decoration conventions (released-button 3D box, broad straight-
  ;; underline usage, frequent inverse-video).  Rustcity follows the
  ;; minimalist line on every attribute below.  Its higher-pop strategy
  ;; (see B above) spends itself on hue, not on decoration.
  ;;
  ;; :underline t
  ;;   Survey: minimalist themes confine straight underline to (a)
  ;;   actionable navigation (`link', `link-visited').  Wave-style
  ;;   underline for diagnostics (flyspell/flycheck) is a separate
  ;;   built-in convention shared by all themes.  Heavier themes
  ;;   additionally underline dates, references, document-structure
  ;;   markers and "intra-mono distinction" cases such as dired
  ;;   permission chars; minimalist themes do NOT (Nord, Catppuccin,
  ;;   Modus do not override `dired-perm-write' / `marginalia-file-
  ;;   priv-*' to add underline).  Rustcity choice: minimalist.
  ;;   Allowed:
  ;;     (a) navigation: `link', `link-visited'.
  ;;     (b) defface-provided straight underline that other minimalist
  ;;         themes also let stand (they don't override): `calendar-
  ;;         today' (defface has `:underline t', conventional today
  ;;         marker -- we restate it to survive the theme replace).
  ;;     (c) wave-style diagnostics (override flyspell/flycheck etc.
  ;;         when needed -- keeps the built-in convention).
  ;;   NOT allowed (do not restate defface underline, do not invent
  ;;   intra-mono underline): document text and heading decoration --
  ;;   `org-date', `org-footnote', `org-ellipsis', `org-column-title',
  ;;   `org-latex-and-related', `eww-valid-certificate', font-lock
  ;;   tty-fallback underlines; and intra-mono distinction faces --
  ;;   `dired-perm-write', `marginalia-file-priv-write', where weight
  ;;   and slant carry the distinction instead.
  ;;
  ;; :weight bold
  ;;   Survey: all themes use bold for hierarchy/structural prominence
  ;;   (headings, outline levels) and state indicators (error/warning/
  ;;   success).  Minimalist themes (Modus) gate it behind a user
  ;;   toggle and default to "only where necessary"; heavier themes
  ;;   additionally bold every font-lock keyword/function-name/type.
  ;;   Rustcity choice: minimalist.  Bold for exactly two roles:
  ;;     (1) Hierarchy / structural prominence -- headings where the
  ;;         bg plane alone cannot carry the body/heading split
  ;;         (`org-document-title', the magit-section-heading and
  ;;         magit-diff-file-heading families, `deft-*',
  ;;         `line-number-current-line', the current tab group and
  ;;         modified tab).
  ;;     (2) State indicators on low-cardinality markers (`error',
  ;;         `warning', `success', `mode-line-buffer-id', `org-tag',
  ;;         the org-agenda date/time markers, the magit process,
  ;;         tag and branch markers, `show-paren-match').
  ;;   No bold on syntax (font-lock-keyword-face etc.) -- color alone
  ;;   carries the semantic, and in neon the color is loud enough that
  ;;   bold on top would be noise.  When defface has bold but rustcity
  ;;   wants to drop it (high-frequency dense markers like `orderless-
  ;;   match-face-*'; chrome neutrals like `header-line'), simply omit
  ;;   `:weight' from the override -- theme replace makes it
  ;;   unspecified automatically.
  ;;
  ;; :box
  ;;   Survey: sparse in all themes (8-45 entries).  Heavier themes
  ;;   (Zenburn) use `:style released-button' on mode-line / headers
  ;;   (legacy 3D look); minimalist themes (Nord, Catppuccin) confine
  ;;   `:box' to clickable affordances with flat `:line-width N :color X'.
  ;;   Rustcity choice: minimalist.  `:box' only where the bg plane
  ;;   alone cannot carry the affordance:
  ;;     - `magit-branch-current' (`:box t' delimits the current
  ;;       branch among a list of branches).
  ;;     - `magit-blame-heading' (sized box frames the blame line).
  ;;     - `transient-nonstandard-key' / `transient-mismatched-key'
  ;;       (a negative-width hue box marks the odd key without moving
  ;;       any text).
  ;;   Otherwise the affordance rides the bg plane (e.g.
  ;;   `help-key-binding' renders the key chip as a `mono2' fill on the
  ;;   `mono0' body plane -- the step is enough, no box is added).
  ;;   No `:style released-button' anywhere.
  ;;
  ;; :slant italic
  ;;   Survey: all themes use italic for secondary/de-emphasized
  ;;   content (comments, docstrings, blockquotes, citations).
  ;;   Italic is gentler than bold and does not impede plane reading;
  ;;   even minimalist themes use it readily.  Rustcity follows the
  ;;   common pattern.  Used on: `font-lock-comment-face',
  ;;   `marginalia-file-priv-link', `magit-branch-upstream',
  ;;   `org-agenda-clocking', `org-agenda-date-today' (with bold),
  ;;   `org-foresight-agenda-derived' and
  ;;   `org-foresight-agenda-free' (both of which mark an entry the
  ;;   user did not write themselves).
  ;;
  ;; :inverse-video
  ;;   Survey: minimalist themes (Nord 0, Catppuccin tty fallback only,
  ;;   Modus sparse) avoid it; heavier themes (Doom, Zenburn) use it
  ;;   sparsely.  Reason for avoiding: explicit bg/fg pairs are more
  ;;   predictable and interact more cleanly with the mono-ramp planes.
  ;;   Rustcity choice: never use `:inverse-video'.  Where defface has
  ;;   it (`org-todo', `org-done', `org-date-selected'), rustcity writes
  ;;   the equivalent display as an explicit `:foreground' / `:background'
  ;;   pair (theme replace drops the defface inverse-video for free).
  ;;
  ;; :inherit (not a decoration but related)
  ;;   When defface `:inherit' aligns with rustcity intent, RESTATE it
  ;;   explicitly (theme override replaces defface, so omitted inherit
  ;;   is dropped).  When defface `:inherit' conflicts, re-target it
  ;;   (e.g. `dired-directory' -> `font-lock-type-face', `font-lock-
  ;;   doc-face' -> `mono4').
  ;;
  ;; Typeface
  ;;   Families are the user's to choose, so the theme states color and
  ;;   never `:family'.  `fixed-pitch' and `variable-pitch' are left to
  ;;   their defface entirely; faces that must be monospaced regardless
  ;;   of what the surrounding text uses say so by inheriting
  ;;   `fixed-pitch' (`tooltip', `help-key-binding').
  ;;
  ;; Face-stack defence reset (`:weight normal :slant normal')
  ;;   Defface sometimes places an explicit normal-reset to prevent
  ;;   weight/slant inheriting from the face stack below (overlay
  ;;   before-string, text under another face's region).  Rustcity
  ;;   preserves the reset only where the inheritance path exists:
  ;;   `magit-blame-heading' (before-string overlay; magit source
  ;;   comments on the inheritance risk), `org-column' (drawn atop
  ;;   underlying buffer text).  Margin overlays and independent
  ;;   regions do NOT need it -- `magit-log-author' / `magit-log-date'
  ;;   live in the margin overlay so the reset is omitted.
  ;;
  ;; No explicit `:foo unspecified'
  ;;   Theme override replaces defface entirely, so omitting an
  ;;   attribute IS unspecified.  Writing `:foo unspecified' carries
  ;;   no functional effect; the documentation value is covered by
  ;;   this block.  We therefore do not write any `:foo unspecified'
  ;;   in the spec list below.
